Things I can't/don't want to do

1. Make pods2html emit a frameset with the index in one frame and
the POD in the other.

This is an easy hack on pods2html for anyone who wants it.
If people want lots of hacks like this, it might be worth adding
hooks to pods2html to support them.


2. Remove the ($] >= 5.005 ? key from Makefile.PL
I had a complaint that this syntax breaks on Cygwin, but I can no
longer contact the person who reported it to confirm the problem.


3. Generate an index and TOC in the sytle of Marek::Pod::Html
This is
- beyond the scope of POD
- beyond the scope of Pod::Tree


4. XHTML support
I've had a request for XHTML compliance.
I thought this would be easy
- downcase all the tags
- maybe a few other tweaks

However, Pod::Tree::HTML uses HTML::Stream to emit the HTML, so doing
this means either hacking or replacing that module. I don't want to do
the first, and the second is a big job.


5. Solaris problem
A test failure on Solaris that I don't understand and probably can't
reproduce. This may be another example of the $Config{perlpath} vs.
perl problem.
  

6. Complaint of -w warnings on empty paragraphs
I can't reproduce this, and I haven't been able to contact the
reporter. 


7. HTML classes for CSS
I have a request to specify HTML classes to support CSS. It's not hard
to do, but it bulks up both the code and the generated HTML, and it
isn't clear that it gains anything. Style sheets can use HTML element
names as selectors. POD is so simple that I don't think there are any
HTML elements that are used in more than one context.
